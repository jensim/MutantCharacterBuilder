<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<h3>User data</h3>
<p>
	I will not give out or by any means share private information given me by you directly or by trusted party, if not forced by law.<br/>
	However, It is my goal not to keep user information in the system, unless I absolutely have to.<br/>
	I keep no passwords stored, and I require no names, I prefer it that way.
</p>
<h3>Oauth tokens</h3>
<p>
	When signing in with a user account from a trusted party, Rollspelsportalen is given an access_token,<br/>
	if the Oauth provider you signed in with has support for ending access_token life, I end it on<br/>
	active logout from the site. Otherwise you end the token life through the providers own web interface.
