		<h1>Character Builder toolkit</h1>
		<p>This started out as a project for generating characters, and maintaining these.</p>
		<p>The project has always been driven by my need to evolve as a programmer and thuss been afflicted by my current cravings to learn new technologies.</p>
		<p>My underlying objective through it all is my love to Swedish old style role playing games, those where you play by speaking your mind and rolling dice!<br />
			Personally, I&#39;m not much of a dice rolling man, I tend to rely on facts, figures and solid arguments, and that might shine through for those out there who are dedicated chance-junkies.</p>
